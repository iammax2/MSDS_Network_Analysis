# MSDS_Network_Analysis

by Maxfield Thompson, Lauren Gardiner, and Jacob Jones

The following notebook will compute a superficial network analysis of Facebook data. The dataset used consists of 'circles' (or 'friends lists') from Facebook. The dataset includes node features (profiles), circles, and ego networks. 

Here is a description of the dataset and a [link:](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html) 

"Facebook data has been anonymized by replacing the Facebook-internal ids for each user with a new value. Also, while feature vectors from this dataset have been provided, the interpretation of those features has been obscured. For instance, where the original dataset may have contained a feature "political=Democratic Party", the new data would simply contain "political=anonymized feature 1". Thus, using the anonymized data it is possible to determine whether two users have the same political affiliations, but not what their individual political affiliations represent."

Also, much of the code for this project was inspired and/or used from the [LeJit's FacebookNetwork repository](https://app.dominodatalab.com/u/LeJit/FacebookNetwork/browse?)
